      "[['session', 'year', 'country', 'text', 'name', 'region', 'continent', 'latitude', 'longitude'], ['44', '1989', 'MDV', \"Ã¯Â»Â¿It is indeed a pleasure for me and the members of my delegation to extend to Ambassador Garba our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His election to this high office is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualities and experience. I am fully confident that under his able and wise leadership the Assembly will further consolidate the gains achieved during the past year.My delegation associates itself with previous speakers in expressing its appreciation of the dedicated efforts of his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo for the exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.As in previous years my delegation wishes to note its satisfaction with and gratitude for the assiduous and unrelenting efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the cause of peace and international harmony. We pay a tribute to him for his untiring efforts to promote conditions conducive to the realization of the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations we praise and congratulate him on the successes the Organization has achieved in recent years. More particularly we praise him for the renewed faith and regeneration of confidence in the Organization and its ability to Play an instrumental role in the peaceful settlement of disputes.  Today we find ourselves at an important crossroads. Recent years have witnessed a welcome positive change in the international political climate. The confrontational tone evident in super-Power relations not too long ago continues to show signs of thawing. At the same time a number of regional and sub regional conflicts have taken momentous strides towards resolution. Many more protracted conflicts show signs of hope and movement. Though one might argue that the present situation continues to be delicate the process made can hardly escape notice and is indeed worthy of recognition. Developments in southern Africa and more particularly in Namibia with regard to the implementation of the United Nations independence plan are welcome signals of hope but amidst the hopes there are still dark reminders of the precariousness of global political reconciliation. A number of problems remain unsolved and several of these such as the conflicts in the Middle East continue to simmer.We are therefore at an important crossroads. We feel that there is enough good will to set in motion the process of evolution towards peace and stability. We see signs that the human intellect is resourceful enough to devise ideas that are conducive to our survival. Fresh concepts of peace and security have gained currency but at the same time we continue to live under the dark shadow of nuclear devices. The proliferation of nuclear weapons both horizontally and vertically is a tragic reminder of the difficulties and obstacles which stand between mankind and lasting peace.On the economic front hard choices need to be made. The 1980s have witnessed one of the longest spells of growth for the industrialized countries while the situation in the South particularly in the least developed countries continues to deteriorate. Benefits of trade continue to be disproportionate. Commodity prices have not regained their value in real terms. Aid flows continue to be inadequate. The debt burden borne by many third world countries is stifling economic growth and efforts for development causing political instability. The link between economic development and the environment has recently been recognized and it is encouraging to note the high profile given to environmental issues at the Paris summit meeting of the Group of Seven in July this year in this regard it is of particular interest that there is an increasing awareness and acceptance of the fact that certain technologies have a deleterious effect on the environment. The question is how these technologies can be replaced through a global programme of co-operation.No single fact no single object defines our moment in civilization more than does the existence of large nuclear arsenals. we have the horrible capacity to destroy our planet several times other either by accident or by design. Nuclear weapons instil fear and beget mistrust and insecurity. They have a remarkable tendency to set hostile relations in concrete. They aggravate the security dilemma of states and perpetuate a confliction mode of behaviour. This therefore fuels the arms race and defence budgets soar while expenditures that are benevolent tend to plummet. The UN Conference on the relationship between disarmament and development served as a timely reminder of the opportunity costs of armaments both nuclear and conventional. However the opportunity cost of nuclear weaponry is not only development. The international political climate and the security perceptions of states as well as the environment are actual and potential sacrifices tonuclear weapons. Furthermore. the potential horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons issues the stark and grim warning that regional rivalries would be on an ever shorter fuse and that cataclysm would be that much closer.It is in view of these strong objections  to nuclear weapons and their Proliferation and deployment that my delegation has consistently and strongly supported United Nations calls for disarmament.The confidence that can he derived from genuine arms reduction has a pervasive effect on the security environment. The transition that many of the world's conflict are making towards negotiations and understanding owes a great deal to improved relations between the super-Powers which were themselves in part inspired by the historic arms reduction agreement of December 1987 for this reason -at Maldives has always supported all efforts with a view to general and complete disarmament including the total elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons and reduction in conventional armaments. We also believe that nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace could inspire trust good Will and operation among states transforming into secure communities contributing to global peace and security. We therefore support calls for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace. I express my delegation's fullest support for the people of Namibia with our Namibia achieved their independence.  Apartheid is an affront to mankind and a crime against humanity. No amount of tinkering with it can placate the sense of outrage and indignation felt by the world community for this immoral practice. No amount of cosmetic change can restore Justice and dignity to the oppressed majority in South Africa. Maldives express our solidarity with the oppressed majority in South Africa in their struggle against apartheid. We condemn unequivocally the system of apartheid and condemn Pretoria regime for its continued defiance of the UN resolutions.  By far the greatest conflict in our time has been and continues to be the conflict in the Middle East. At the heart of this conflict is the question of Palestine. However it is only in recent years that the Palestinian issue has evoked even a reasoned amount of concern in some key States. The search for peace continues to be frustrated by the hard-line and obstinate policies of Israel. Meanwhile the situation in the occupied territories continues to deteriorate. The 22 month long intifadah emphasizes the intensity of the situation posed by Zionist occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories including Jerusalem.The Government of Maldives strongly condemns the use of brutal force and the blatant abuse of human rights by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. We also deplore the continued defiance by Israel of United Nations resolutions and its violation of international law and all norms of civilized behaviour. We reiterate our full support and solidarity with the people of Palestine in their just struggle for self-determination and independence. We therefore welcome the overwhelming international support for the uprising which is being viewed as the just and valiant struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their inalienable rights. We extend our whole-hearted support to the proposal for an early convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the full and independent participation of Palestine.The situation in Lebanon remains volatile. The civil war now in its fifteenth year continues to take an increasing toll of human life. We fervently hope that with the developments taking place in the region and elsewhere the question of Lebanon will be solved in a manner which will restore its independence and national integrity and alleviate the sufferings of its people. We welcome the efforts undertaken by the members of the Arab league both past and present to resolve the situation in Lebanon and we request the international community to give their support to the people of Lebanon in their efforts to solve their problems.On a more hopeful note we are pleased that contrary to some early pessimistic assessments the cease-fire agreed on between Iran and Iraq in the Gulf has held firm indicating the sincerity of the parties to the conflict. We welcome the commitments undertaken by them to resolve the conflict by peaceful means. In particular we applaud the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General for the resolution of this conflict and urge both parties to maintain the momentum of peace created and envisaged by the cease-fire. While we welcome the positive developments in Afghanistan - I refer to the withdraw of foreign troops - we regret that the situation has not been completely settled. We reiterate our call upon all parties concerned to adhere to the provisions of the Geneva Agreements in order not to frustrate the prevailing opportunities for a just and lasting solution to the problem. We urge the international community to provide humanitarian and economic assistance for the relief and rehabilitation of refugees as well as for the long-term reconstruction of that ravaged country.  Positive strides have been taken towards the solution of the Kampuchean problem. We welcome the withdraw of the Vietnamese troops and we appreciate the diplomatic efforts to obtain a comprehensive and lasting solution to the dispute including the Jakarta informal meeting as well as the international conference in Paris. However realizing the delicacy of the current situation we call upon all parties concerned to exercise restraint. The process of reunification of peoples should be through peaceful means and by the creation of conditions conducive to reconciliation peace and stability among those sharing the same aspirations. We remain optimistic about the prospects for peaceful national reconciliation in the Korean peninsula. The good office of the UN could be utilized in these peace negotiations.  Another issue that needs our attention is the situation in Cyprus. That prolonged inter-communal dispute should be solved urgently with due regard to the national integrity of the nation and the aspirations of its peoples. We welcome the recent high-level contacts between the two communities and hope that the revived inter-communal dialogue will lead to inter-communal reconciliation on the basis of equality and integrity for both communities. We commend the tireless and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General in searching for a settlement to the conflict.As I have already noted the world economic situation continues to be bleak for the developing countries. Their situation has been worsened by the limited of aid since the early 1980s rampant domestic inflation crippling debts and the exorbitant burden of debt-servicing. The situation is aggravated by their falling share in international trade by persistent negative trends in the terms of trade owing to protectionism and by the upsurge in unilateralism and other practices that jeopardize the multilateral nature of trade. It is regrettable that on the whole despite recent measures whereby the resources of the international finance institutions have been increased by the plans of some of the most developed countries to recycle part of their surplus into the developing countries the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) as official development assistance has not been met. Moreover as regards the least developed countries which continue to register negative growth rates the official development assistance target of 0.15 per cent of GNP has not been met either.Economic insecurity is not the only visible threat facing many of us in the world today. Indeed we consider the environment to be one of the most important aspects of the quality of life that we have to address now in our quest for economic and industrial development. We welcome the proposed United Nations conference on environment and development and regard the event as a valuable opportunity which should be fully utilized to promote a comprehensive approach to the environmental problems related to the development activities of mankind.While serious efforts are being made at global regional and national levels to protect the environment my delegation is particularly concerned about the effects of the degradation of the environment especially the depletion of the ozone layer and the consequent global warming and rise in sea level. Maldives is a low-lying archipelagic State entirely dependent upon its surrounding seas. Any degradation of the marine ecosystem or any rise in the mean sea level is a matter of grave concern to the Maldives it will be recalled that two years ago we witnessed the fury of tidal eruptions which caused extensive damage with the assistance of friendly countries we have embarked upon a programme of protecting the populated islands from possible natural calamities. Tidal waves hurricanes and typhoons are increasingly frequent phenomena and today there is a greater awareness that man's tampering with the environment and certain technologies inimical to the environment do have a direct bearing on the behaviour of the global weather system.Maldives therefore strongly supports the call for environmental preservation and is already a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Our interest in the issue continues undiminished and we welcome the universal interest that has been expressed in the preservation of the environment. I should like also to mention that in November this year the Maldives will host a conference of small States on sea-level rise. We are confident that the conference will contribute to the global efforts in addressing this important issue.It is an old and true maxim that the best indicator of the strength and stability of an international security system or political order is the survival of its weakest members. That being the case and in view of the implications the ever-increasing dangers of terrorism and mercenarism to the sovereignty of small and weak States are appalling.Terrorism is not simply a minor irritant to anybody - least of all to the small nations whose sovereignty is not only held hostage but can be easily usurped. The very existence of this possibility in the first place does not augur well for the security of the international community. The cherished principles that have so long contributed to the survival of the present State system and that are indispensable values of our global civilization are at stake. Today it may be we the small States whose sovereignty can be robbed by a handful of mercenaries or a gang of bounty hunters. Tomorrow it could be the larger countries which even at present face some erosion of their sovereignty and security by similar acts. The difference is that when a small State is subjected to a terrorist onslaught or an invasion by mercenaries the consequences can be irreversible both in political and in economic terms. We in the Maldives were close to becoming the victim of such a dastardly attempt last November.It is evident that peoples engaging in acts of terrorism and mercenarism which endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States need to be deterred. The security of small States is too weak to be taken care of by mere self-help. The implications that efforts to strengthen their own security have for the prospects of economic development through the severe if at all affordable opportunity costs and the impact on social and political values as well as the long-term implications for the sustenance of democracy in a militarised society are negative. By requesting the inclusion on the agenda of the Assembly of an item related to the protection and security of small States we sought to highlight the issue that I have just mentioned. We brought the issue to this forum not because we are unwilling to defend our values nor have we taken it up here because our peoples lack valour. Small States do have as friends States that can assist and have assisted in strengthening their security. While we are grateful for the sense of duty that these friends have shown it is with regret that we note that bilateral security arrangements in the international system have not yet evolved to a level of maturity whereby the interests of the weaker partner can be safeguarded. Nor are the socio-political identity of the weaker State and the principle of sovereign equality strong enough to be impervious to the possible vicissitudes of unequal relationships. Moreover our political systems continue to be afflicted by misconceptions which can distort actions taken with the best of intentions. Consequently the greater the power differential the greater the propensity to misconceptions and the more hapless the predicament of the weaker parties. It is for this reason that we believe that multilateral frameworks are the most feasible nodes of a sound security mechanism for the weakest Members of the Organization even if the actual support or assistance in a given situation is rendered at a regional or bilateral level.As I noted earlier it is my humble opinion that we are at a pivotal point an important crossroads in our global political development. It is our belief that we are at a particularly auspicious moment in history to forge ahead in strengthening the norms of our global political and security systems. Thus it is our sincere hope that the Organization will take a similar momentous step a leap forward in ushering in a new era of security for the small States. We trust that this critical step will be taken to safeguard the principles which are espoused by the Organization and on which the survival of a large number of this community depends.\", 'Maldives', 'Southern and Central Asia', 'Asia', '3.25', '73'], ['44', '1989', 'FIN', \"Ã¯Â»Â¿May I begin by congratulating you. Sir on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your wide experience in the United Nations makes you especially qualified to guide the Assembly and its deliberations. You have my best wishes for the demanding task that lies ahead of you. May I also express my thanks to the outgoing President Mr. Dante Caputo who so ably fulfilled his role on behalf of the Assembly. It gives me particular pleasure to pay tribute to the Secretary-General. We owe a great deal to his authority and leadership.As we are assembled here for the annual general debate every Member state needs to reflect on certain fundamental questions. Is the United Nations doing everything possible in order to meet its challenges? Are we making progress? Can we say that the United Nations enters the last decade of this century with determination and justified self-confidence? Is my own country doing everything it can in order to help the world Organization? The answers to these questions must be sought in the actual work of the Organization and of its Member States. For my part I shall try to emphasize some of the challenges we in Finland regard as particularly imports at the present time. It seems to us that the main challenges can be expressed in two words -insecurity and poverty. Both produce fear  d suffering. Neither can be dealt with by any single remedy.The United Nations was created first and foremost in order to maintain international peace and security. In this respect the past year represents a mixture of success and disappointment. We are encouraged by the high-level dialogues that have continued between the major Powers. we have witnessed with satisfaction such concrete achievements as the continuing progress in the verified dismantling and destruction of American and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear weapons. As one of the participating States in the process of the Conference on Security and cooperation in Europe Finland follow closely and with much hope the new efforts to achieve substantive conventional disarmament in Europe.At the same time we are concerned about the violence that has erupted and continues in many parts of the world. Most of the underlying problem are already on the agenda of the General Assembly and we shall express our views on them in due course. Now I want to speak about the global challenges. As regards the process of disarmament on the global level our hopes in Finland are fastened particularly on the preparation of a chemical weapons convention. The political will is there as was demonstrated again at the conferences held in Paris and in Canberra this year. During this year as before Finnish experts have continued their research in order to help to develop appropriate methods that could meet the complex verification requirements  global and comprehensive chemical weapons convention. We expect progress from the protracted negotiations with growing impatience. We welcome the impetus recently given them in the bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.Security on the global level must take into account other factors in addition to armaments and military threats. Security requires confidence in the future. Such confidence must be felt both by Governments and by their peoples. Only a representative Government that respects human rights and that therefore enjoys the confidence of its own people can face the future with a sense of security and successfully maintain stable relations with other Governments. Some dramatic - in fact tragic - events have recently illustrated the importance of respect for human rights. We hope that lessons have been learned.Confidence in the future also requires that the other global challenge that of poverty be overcome. The sufferings of poverty may not be in evidence everywhere but the challenge requires global co-operation for development. The Assembly will meet next year in a special session devoted to international economic co-operation. Soon thereafter a new international development strategy for the 1990s should be adopted. A successful special session and a new and realistic strategy should help to bring about a new spirit of international economic co-operation.In the process of preparing both the development strategy and the special session emphasis should be on the development of human resources in all forms including the recognition of a well-functioning private sector in balance with an effective public sector. In that context funding generated by national and international sources should be well co-ordinated. The necessary investments in developing countries require increasing domestic and external financing.The debt overhang has resulted in the transfer of resources from developing countries which exceeded $US 50 billion last year a trend that should be reversed. This requires that a political solution including a functioning debt strategy be found. The debt overhang cannot be overcome by the international community at the upcoming special session of the General Assembly and in the new international development strategy. It would be important for the efforts to reverse the transfer of resources from the developing countries if the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as development-and transfer were generally reached. For its part Finland will this year reach that target set by the General Assembly.The structure of the United Nations in the economic and social fields should respond to the tasks to be specified in the strategy for the 1990s thus -consolidating the role of the world Organization. The Finnish Government finds that the Secretary-General has a major catalytic role to play in putting forward concrete proposals to improve the Organization's effectiveness in those fields. That would also help Governments in agreeing on the areas where they are to concentrate the activities of the United Nations in the economic and social fields. Today I wish to emphasize two issues that must in my opinion have a Prominent place in this respect. Development cannot be sustainable if the world population continues to grow at its present rate. Development cannot be sustainable if the natural resources of the Earth continue to be depleted at the present rate. There is a growing awareness of such problems in all parts of the world. That awareness is more and more strongly reflected in the work of the United Nations it has prompted a number of positive measures. More is needed.According to recent United Nations estimates the world population could stabilize in the twenty-first century at the level of 10 to 11 billion persons. An early stabilisation of population growth would of course facilitate the fight against poverty. To reach that goal determined population policies translated into national population plans as spelled out in the World Population Plan of Action should be pursued vigorously.With regard to the protection of the environment no problem has lately becomeso apparent and widely recognized as the problem of climate change. Both industrialized and developing countries are directly affected by the depletion of the ozone layer through increasing emissions of carbon dioxides which produce the so-called greenhouse effect in the climate of the Earth and by the increasing presence of substances in the atmosphere that cause acid rain and direct dangers to health.It is therefore hardly a surprise that we have witnessed increasing international activity in this field. Several initiatives have been taken to launch concerted international action to combat atmospheric pollution in all its aspects including climatic change. It is our view that effective strategies and policies should be developed by the international community as soon as possible in all fields relating to environment. That is a major undertaking that requires consolidated effort by the General Assembly and by the relevant United Nations specialized and other agencies. Environmental problems have a universal character. Any new activities should be streamlined with already ongoing action and well-established treaty-making procedures. The General Assembly must play a pivotal role in that effort.Five months ago Finland hosted a Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer aid the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Those instruments of 1985 and 1987 respectively have this year already been found inadequate in light of the latest advances in knowledge. At the Conference the representatives of the more than 80 States present agreed unanimously to the Helsinki Declaration on the Protection of  the Ozone Layer which contains an ambitious undertaking to phase out completely the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000 or sooner if possible and to phase out other ozone-depleting substances as soon as possible. We expect that undertaking to be converted into a legally binding decision at next year's meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Appropriate measures should also be undertaken to make environmentally sound substitutes widely available to developing countries as soon as possible.In the field of environment protection the problems that are typical in the industrialized countries are often also found in the big urban centres of the developing countries. The problems that are now typical in many developing countries - such as soil erosion and the destruction of forests - illustrate mistakes already committed by earlier generations most of all in Europe. We can therefore all learn from each other. There is information available about the environment and its protection and about earlier mistakes. The available knowledge needs to be applied and converted into practical programmes not only on the level of global strategies but also on the level of regional national and local development.In our own development co-operation programmes we in Finland have emphasized such activities as deforestation where we feel that we have some experience and expertise. We see deforestation as urgent in order to help stop soil erosion counteract the greenhouse effect and counterbalance the continued cutting of trees for fuel and for other immediate human needs. In this respect the development of new and renewable soirees of energy is of crucial importance.On a broader scale we look forward to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We see it as representing probably the most important joint effort required of mankind during the remaining part of this century. This session of the General Assembly is called upon to take important decisions for the preparation of the Conference. In that connection as in all our activities to face up to environmental problems we in Finland will strongly emphasize the need to support the developing countries in order to ensure that their development is environmentally sustainable.A large part of the burden particularly for financing research and the introduction of new environmentally sound technologies will have to be borne by the industrialized countries. We accept our part of this burden knowing of course that all states will have to share in the efforts according to their capabilities. Since concern for the environment is global this concern should in our opinion give a further incentive to all States without exception to involve themselvesactively in international co-operation for environmentally sound and sustainable development. We also think that the time is ripe for the preparation of structural reforms making the United Nations Organization more responsive to the problems of protecting the environment. My Government has an open mind regarding the various ideas that have been discussed. We would find it natural for this Assembly to take decisions ensuring environmental Questions a permanent and prominent place in the structure of the Organization.One of the activities of the United Nations which has rightly gained prominence during this year is peace-keeping. At the present time Finland is the biggest contributor of personnel to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Their total strength is close to 15000 and the number of Finnish personnel is now almost 2000. It is therefore with particular satisfaction that we in Finland share the pride felt in this house over the latest Nobel Peace Prize which was awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In co-operation with the other Nordic countries Finland has this year taken steps to share with other interested States its experiences concerning the training and preparation of national contingents for peace-keeping tasks.We are also satisfied at the reactivation of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations. The accumulated experiences in this field have already grown to such an extent that it is high time indeed to make a thorough review of all practical proposals that may help to strengthen the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping.In this connection I wish to emphasize the importance of finding a lasting solution to the financial difficulties that still affect current peace-keeping operations thus indirectly undermining the financial basis of the whole Organization. The idea of having sufficient financial reserves for peacemaking and peace-keeping particularly for the start-up phase of operations which my   predecessor put forward in his address to the General Assembly last year has received support in a number of Quarters. I note in particular that the Secretary-General in his own report to the General Assembly has referred to the possibility of establishing a special reserve fund for peace-keeping to be supported by all Member States. We hope that this idea can soon be followed up in practice with full respect for the principle of collective responsibility. The first condition in our view is that Member states should accept the principle of financing all operations without exception through assessed contributions and that they should pay all their assessed contributions in full and on time.The principal factor explaining the recent growth in the participation of Finnish personnel in United Nations peace-keeping is the deployment of an enlarged battalion within the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia. A sizable number of volunteer soldiers has thus been added to the two Finnish battalions and smaller units already serving in the Middle East and elsewhere.Namibia is a major test for the United Nations. The beginnings of the UOTAG operations to implement Security Council resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia were unexpectedly rough and difficult. It is still too early to draw conclusions from the whole process of transition to independence but we believe that the programme has been brought back on track thanks to the persistent efforts of the Secretary-General and the competent performance of the UNTAG personnel. Of course many problems still remain to be solved and call for our unrelenting attention. We are looking forward with confidence to the moment when we can welcome independent Namibia into our midst as a Member State of the United Nations. For Finland Namibia will be a major partner in our development co-operation.  The situation in the Middle East continues to pose a persistent threat to international security. The dangers of the absence of peace in the area are demonstrated almost daily. Repressive measures continue in the territories illegally occupied by Israel. The cycle of violence has not been broken. Theeking turmoil in Lebanon gives cause for deep concern. There must be a way to or the suffering of the Lebanese people by the common endeavours of the Lebanese themselves the Arab League and the international community.It is pressingly urgent that the way should be prepared towards an international peace conference and further to a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. There is an almost universal recognition of the basic principles for a settlement. The right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries as well as the right of the Palestinians to national determination should be recognised. Democratic elections in the occupied territories could facilitate this process. If such elections are properly mentored and take place within the framework of a structured effort they could provide a link in a process leading to a comprehensive settlement. The momentum for achieving a solution to this long-standing conflict will be lost unless all possible avenues are pursued vigorously and with an open mind. In this respect the proposals made by President Mubarak of Egypt are welcome and merit serious consideration.The United Nations has manifestly demonstrated its relevance and strengthened its role as a forum for co-ordinated international action. Yet the world Organization and its member States can do more. Serious global problems call for urgent global solutions. Only a re-invigorated United Nations can answer the challenges the world will inevitably face in the 1990s and beyond. Let us unite our forces to make the United Nations capable of meeting those challenges. \", 'Finland', 'Nordic Countries', 'Europe', '64', '26']]\n"
